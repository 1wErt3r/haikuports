SUMMARY="A perl module for simple terminal control"
DESCRIPTION="Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple control over \
terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking reads, if the \
architecture allows, and some generalized handy functions for working with terminals. One of the \
main goals is to have the functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in \"use \
Term::ReadKey\" on any architecture and have a good likelihood of it working."
